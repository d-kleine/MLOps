### Deploying a Machine Learning Model on Heroku with FastAPI

Deploying a machine learning model in Production:
-	Modeling performance, checking for bias using data cross-sections (called "slices"), and writing a model map
-	Version control of data and models with Data Version Control (DVC) 
-	Continuous Integration with GitHub Actions and Continuous Delivery/Deployment
-	Fast, type-checked and autodocumented writing of a user interface (API) with FastAPI

### A Dynamic Risk Assessment System

Full automation of MLOps processes:
-	Model training and deployment
-	Establish regular assessment processes: Re-training and re-deployment of models at model drift.
-	Diagnose operational issues with models, including data integrity and stability issues, timing issues, and dependency issues 
-	Setup of automated reports for APIs
